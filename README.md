# Escape

Escape the mandatory requirement of logically client only mods on the server. We players are free to install permitted mods!!!

## Reason
It's quite common that some mods is imcompatible with each other, such as Emojiful and Modern UI. I prefer modernui much more. Considering emojiful SHOULD BE a client only mod (and it marks as such in the 'mods.toml' file of Forge), I disabled it, but then was refused to join the server because of its new registry entry (recipe type) of recipe for custom emoji. Fine, so I developed this mod, after all, I REALLY CANT DO WITHOUT modernui :(

## Plan
I may add patches for more mods in similar situations in the future.
